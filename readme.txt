## The Easiest and Most Straightforward Way to Build Page Sections

Stackable lets you reimagine the way you use the WordPress Block Editor for a truly easy and intuitive way of building stunning web pages. With Stackable, you can build entire page sections by using a single block with the built-in section / background controls. There’s really nothing like it.

Stackable blocks are designed to be highly versatile and usable either as:

1. units that can be combined with other blocks, or
2. stand-alone sections, which can easily be achieved by turning on the block background settings (a uniquely Stackable feature).

Having this flexibility makes Stackable an all-in-one tool for building your website.

## Stunning Layouts and Pre-set Section / Block Designs

Together with this new way of building sections, we’ll start you off with great built-in multiple block layouts and pre-set section / block designs. All our designs are stunning, professionally-made and ready-to-use.

Unlike any other block library, our pre-set section / block designs are **cohesive across almost all blocks, making them truly useable for building full websites**. Gain access to a very diverse collection of pre-set designs and layouts which are all **interchangeable with one click!**

We have absolutely the best and most expansive design collection with 50+ block layouts and 60+ pre-set design sections (with more on the way!).

## Design with Powerful Precision Controls in an Intuitive UI

Stackable now offers the most advanced block design controls with the widest range of design settings. With this block collection, enjoy:

- Intuitive and easy to use block design settings for the easiest page building experience for casual users like entrepreneurs, bloggers, and DIYers
- Highly advanced precision options for professionals and advanced users
- Detailed block settings include:
  - Highly adjustable column and block background options including single tint, gradient tint, image and video
  - Flexible typography options including text highlight options
  - Cutting-edge color settings including built-in gradient tint and gradient blend mode options
  - Advanced image settings and responsive image loading
  - Precision controls for block dimensions, spacing and alignment
  - Highly detailed responsiveness block options for pixel perfect tablet and mobile designs
  - Built-in separators / shape dividers for each block

All of Stackable's powerful options are easily managed in an intuitive UI for a smooth block editing experience. This is achieved by our three-tab configuration, easy toggle on/off for block elements, and streamlined settings.

## A Truly Useful Block Library with 27 Quality Gutenberg Blocks

Blocks are the new shortcodes in WordPress 5.0 / Gutenberg.

Stackable gives you lots of awesome blocks for you to create awesome landing pages and front pages.

**Can I use this with other block plugins?**

Yes! Stackable blocks play well with other blocks.
