== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

You’ll need WordPress version 5.0 or higher for this to work. For versions below 5.0, you'll need to use the Gutenberg plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is Gutenberg? Why WordPress 5.0?**

Gutenberg is what the cool kids call the new content editor that came out in WordPress 5.0.

The new content editor replaces the old text editor, and it gives you a more visual way of creating your content.

With WordPress 5.0 & Gutenberg, you build your pages using *blocks*, and Stackable provides you with lots of cool ones.

**What are blocks?**

Blocks are the new shortcodes in WordPress 5.0 / Gutenberg.

They're the basic elements that you add into your content to build your pages, like buttons, cards, videos, etc.

Stackable gives you lots of awesome blocks for you to create awesome landing pages and front pages.

**Can I use this with other block plugins?**

Yes! Stackable blocks play well with other blocks.

**Can I use this add-on for other page builders I’m using?**

Nope. Stackable only works with Gutenberg, the new WordPress editor.
