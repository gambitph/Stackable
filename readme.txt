## The Easiest and Most Straightforward Way to Build Page Sections

Stackable lets you reimagine the way you use the WordPress Block Editor for a truly easy and intuitive way of building stunning web pages. With Stackable, you can build entire page sections by using a single block with the built-in section / background controls. There’s really nothing like it.

Stackable blocks are designed to be highly versatile and usable either as:

1. units that can be combined with other blocks, or
2. stand-alone sections, which can easily be achieved by turning on the block background settings (a uniquely Stackable feature).

Having this flexibility makes Stackable an all-in-one tool for building your website.

## Stunning Layouts and Pre-set Section / Block Designs

Together with this new way of building sections, we’ll start you off with great built-in multiple block layouts and pre-set section / block designs. All our designs are stunning, professionally-made and ready-to-use.

Unlike any other block collection, our pre-set section / block designs are **cohesive across almost all blocks, making them truly useable for building full websites**. Gain access to a very diverse collection of pre-set designs and layouts which are all **interchangeable with one click!**

We have absolutely the best and most expansive design collection with 50+ block layouts and 60+ pre-set design sections (with more on the way!).

## Design with Powerful Precision Controls in an Intuitive UI

Stackable now offers the most advanced block design controls with the widest range of design settings. With this block collection, enjoy:

- Intuitive and easy to use block design settings for the easiest page building experience for casual users like entrepreneurs, bloggers, and DIYers
- Highly advanced precision options for professionals and advanced users
- Detailed block settings include:
  - Highly adjustable column and block background options including single tint, gradient tint, image and video
