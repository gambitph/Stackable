# Block Title Module

This module connects to the `ContentAlignControl` in order to reset the title & description aligments.

# Developer Notes

If the block uses this module, you will need to use the `PanelSpacingBody` component in order to adjust the title & description bottom margins / spacing.

It's required for the block to use the `withTabbedInspector` HOC for displaying options.
