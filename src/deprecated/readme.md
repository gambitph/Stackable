Deprecated Folder
=================

All the files here are for deprecation / backward compatibility with either old WordPress / Gutenberg / Stackable versions.

This folder contains the following:

## `v2`

When we moved from v2 to v3, we devised a new block architecture which completely changed how the blocks worked. The existing v2 blocks will now be left as they are and will continue to be included in the plugin.

## `v1`

When blocks were migrated from v1.17.x to v2, a lot of CSS styles were changed. Due to the nature of the Block Editor, existing v1 blocks would retain their original structure unless every single post was updated by the user manually. To prevent this, the old styles of the blocks are kept here for the v1 blocks to work properly in the frontend even if Stackable was already upgraded to v2.

The compiled deprecated styles enqueued for users who upgraded from v1 to v2.
