title: PostHog Setup - Begin
description: Start the event tracking setup process by analyzing the project and creating an event tracking plan
---

We're making an event tracking plan for this project.

This is the first of several phases — plan the events, implement them, revise and validate changes, then conclude by creating a dashboard and writing a setup report.

## Task list

As soon as you've read this description and have a rough sense of the work, make a single **call `TaskCreate` immediately** before reading any reference file or beginning analysis. The user is watching the task pane and shouldn't see it sit empty.

It's fine if your first list is incomplete or imprecise. Seed it with whatever high-level items you can infer from the overview above, then call `TaskCreate` again (or `TaskUpdate` to refine existing items) every time your understanding sharpens: after a phase reveals work you didn't anticipate, after planning surfaces concrete sub-items, after you hit something new. Use `TaskUpdate` to mark items `in_progress` when you start them and `completed` when you finish. Keeping the list current matters more than getting it right on the first call.

Keep task titles broad and job-oriented. Describe the purpose or area of work with wording like "Planning event tracking", "Identifying users", "Installing PostHog", "Capturing events", or "Creating dashboards", not the specific files, paths, or symbols involved. Adjust the task names according to the user's project and context.

Before proceeding, find any existing `posthog.capture()` code. Make note of event name formatting.

From the project's file list, select between 10 and 15 files that might have interesting business value for event tracking, especially conversion and churn events. Also look for additional files related to login that could be used for identifying users, along with error handling. Read the files. If a file is already well-covered by PostHog events, replace it with another option. Do not spawn subagents.

Look for opportunities to track client-side events.

**IMPORTANT: Server-side events are REQUIRED** if the project includes any instrumentable server-side code. If the project has API routes (e.g., `app/api/**/route.ts`) or Server Actions, you MUST include server-side events for critical business operations like:

  - Payment/checkout completion
  - Webhook handlers
  - Authentication endpoints

Do not skip server-side events - they capture actions that cannot be tracked client-side.

Create a new file with a JSON array at the root of the project: .posthog-events.json. It should include one object for each event we want to add with these exact field names: `event_name` (the event name), `event_description` (one sentence), and `file` (the file path the event goes in). The wizard reads this file to surface the plan in the UI. If events already exist, don't duplicate them; supplement them.

Track actions only, not pageviews. These can be captured automatically. Exceptions can be made for "viewed"-type events that correspond to the top of a conversion funnel.

As you review files, make an internal note of opportunities to identify users and catch errors. We'll need them for the next step.

## Status

Before beginning a phase of the setup, you will send a status message with the exact prefix '[STATUS]', as in:

[STATUS] Checking project structure.

Status to report in this phase:

- Checking project structure
- Verifying PostHog dependencies
- Generating events based on project

## Abort statuses

If and only if the instructions have `[ABORT]` states specified, and you clearly match the conditions for an abort, emit the abort message. Do NOT attempt to exit or halt yourself — the wizard's middleware catches `[ABORT]` and terminates the run for you.
