# I Can See Errors in AMP Pages

If you've used the [AMP plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/), you might see errors in your pages. The AMP plugin recently released an update that let's it show a lot more warnings than before, and some of the warnings / errors can be safely ignored.

â€‹AMP makes your pages very lightweight for mobile devices, and in order to do this, a lot of your site's styling and javascript \(among other things\) are removed by the plugin. What's retained in your pages is your content. When something is removed, the AMP plugin shows these are warnings or errors.

In order to properly check whether your AMP pages work fine, you'll have to check them in the frontend.
