# Dynamic Sources with Toolset Integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need a **Toolset** subscription to enjoy the benefits of this integration. To use Dynamic Sources, you will need to activate **Toolset Blocks** and **Toolset Types**.
{% endhint %}

You can now start using dynamic sources with our latest integration with [Toolset](http://toolset.com/). The possibilities are now endless since this will allow you to easily display existing content from standard fields, custom fields and taxonomy in Stackableâ€™s Gutenberg blocks.

You can find the list of compatible blocks in Toolset's [documentation](https://toolset.com/documentation/dynamic-sources-in-popular-blocks/).

**Adding a Stackable Block Inside Toolset View Block**

* Click on the plus \(+\) sign on the upper left side of the screen
* Search for the Toolset blocks and select the "View" block
