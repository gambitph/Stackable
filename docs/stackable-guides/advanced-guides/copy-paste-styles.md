# Copy Paste Styles

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is only available in Stackable Premium
{% endhint %}

The Copy Paste Styles is a feature that will allow you to copy the styles of one block and paste it to another so you don't have to manually duplicate it anymore. Pretty self-explanatory right? Yes, it's a simple concept, but a very useful one that is!

The good thing about this new feature is that it supports multi-selection, meaning you can copy multiple block styles. You can also copy paste styles in different posts and pages!
