# WP Project Triage

## When to use

Use this skill to quickly understand what kind of WordPress repo you’re in and what commands/conventions to follow before making changes.

## Inputs required

- Repo root (current working directory).

## Procedure

1. Run the detector (prints JSON to stdout):
   - `node skills/wp-project-triage/scripts/detect_wp_project.mjs`
2. If you need the exact output contract, read:
   - `skills/wp-project-triage/references/triage.schema.json`
3. Use the report to select workflow guardrails:
   - project kind(s)
   - PHP/Node tooling present
   - tests present
   - version hints and sources
4. If the report is missing signals you need, update the detector rather than guessing.

## Verification

- The JSON should parse and include: `project.kind`, `signals`, and `tooling`.
- Re-run after changes that affect structure/tooling (adding `theme.json`, `block.json`, build config).

## Failure modes / debugging

- If it reports `unknown`, check whether the repo root is correct.
- If scanning is slow, add/extend ignore directories in the script.
